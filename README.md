🚀 LCA-Modeller
----------------
*LCA-Modeller* offers a streamlined interface to facilitate the creation of **parametric LCA models** with **prospective capabilities**. It builds on the open-source libraries [*lca-algebraic*](https://lca-algebraic.readthedocs.io/) and [*premise*](https://premise.readthedocs.io/), so having a basic understanding of these tools is recommended.

The core functionality of *LCA-Modeller* revolves around reading a user-provided configuration file that defines the LCA model. From this configuration file, *LCA-Modeller* generates a parametric LCA model with *lca-algebraic*, which can then be evaluated for any parameter values using *lca-algebraic*'s built-in functions.
<br> 
If prospective scenarios are provided, *premise* is used to adapt the EcoInvent database to future conditions. The parametric LCA model then interpolates the prospective databases to enable the evaluation for any year specified by the user.

Additional features include the definition of custom impact assessment methods and the ability to modify existing activities in the EcoInvent database by adding or updating flows.


📦 Installation
----------------
**No pip installation is provided at the moment.** <br>
To install *LCA-Modeller*, setup a separate conda environment:
```bash
conda create -n lca_modeller python==3.10
conda activate lca_modeller
```
And git clone the repository. Then, install *LCA-Modeller* using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) by setting the current directory to the root of the repository and running:
```bash
poetry install
```

A tutorial notebook is provided in the `notebooks` directory to help you get started with *LCA-Modeller*.
